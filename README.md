# amd-dl: Data Science using AMD GPU Deep Learning: Setup Python + Caffe/XGBoost + OpenCL + 1.7x RAM #

Spent time to get a script doing all the needed stuff for Deep Learning on a hybrid AMD GPU: 150 hours or so (spread over 1 year)

Easiest solution was using DeepCL (installs on Windows, installs on Linux without issues...), but clearly the OpenCL Caffe version is about 50x(?) faster for convolutions, which is what I need.

What's a convolution? Example, I assume you got it how optimizations are required for such thing:

```

for (i in 1:n) {

  for (j in 1:n) {
  
    for (k in 1:n) {
    
      for (l in 1:n) {
      
        for (m in 1:n) {
        
          ...
          
        }
        
      }
      
    }
    
  }
  
}

```

Confirmed working on:
* Ubuntu 14.04 flavors
* Elementary OS 0.32 (Ubuntu 14.04)

Compilation problems? Set ~/.bashrc according to the end of this page.

Installation prompts when creating .deb packages so you can reinstall QUICKLY...? Answer the following in order:
  
* Documentation: n
* Changes: Enter
* Install: Enter
* Stuff out of place: n
* Ignore stuff out of place: y

Installation works but using the library/package fails? Use the command provided after checkinstall to uninstall properly!

* Do not try with Python 3.5, it causes errors
* Do NOT install Anaconda before, it causes compilation issues that are barely solvable
* Do NOT install anything else before compiling Caffe, it causes errors randomly
* ALWAYS use a fresh machine
* It is not super optimized for maximum speed (e.g OpenCV pre-compiled for OpenCL<2, etc.)
* Change all "laurae-linux" to $HOME or to your user username in Linux
* Something not working? Reboot and retry, it takes only 20 seconds. Still not working? Check missing dependencies with the error messages.
* Want to apply .bashrc immediately without rebooting/relaunching a terminal? Use the following: source ~/.bashrc
* Got a permission error? Prepend the command with the following: sudo
* Wanna use R for xgboost? You are out of luck, I never managed to compile it correctly:
* error: unable to load shared object '/usr/local/lib/R/site-library/xgboost/libs/xgboost.so': /usr/local/lib/R/site-library/xgboost/libs/xgboost.so: undefined symbol: _ZN7xgboost4data10SparsePage6Writer5AllocEPSt10unique_ptrIS1_St14default_deleteIS1_EE
* Not happy without the bleeding edge xgboost R? Use Windows because it works perfectly there...
* If you really need xgboost in Linux+R, use the typical online R package on CRAN
* DO NOT CLEAN UP ALL THE FOLDERS AFTER, OR YOU WILL KILL REQUIRED DEPENDENCIES. ADJUST THE SCRIPT IF YOU WANT TO PUT THE FILES ELSEWHERE.
* REMEMBER TO SWITCH YOUR GPU TO AMD (if you use hybrid graphics) IF YOU INTEND TO RUN Caffe ON GPU: YOU WILL RUN ON CPU OTHERWISE!!!
