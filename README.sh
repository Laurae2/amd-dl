# AMD GPU Deep Learning: Setup Caffe + OpenCL

# Spent time to get a script doing all the needed stuff for Deep Learning on a hybrid AMD GPU: 150 hours or so (spread over 1 year)
# Easiest solution was using DeepCL (installs on Windows, installs on Linux without issues...), but clearly the OpenCL Caffe version is about 50x(?) faster for convultions, which is what I need.

# Confirmed working on:
# * Ubuntu 14.04 flavors
# * Elementary OS 0.32 (Ubuntu 14.04)

# Compilation problems? Set ~/.bashrc according to the end of this page.
# Installation prompts when creating .deb packages so you can reinstall QUICKLY...? Answer the following in order:
# - Documentation: n
# - Changes: Enter
# - Install: Enter
# - Stuff out of place: n
# - Ignore stuff out of place: y
# Installation works but using the library/package fails? Use the command provided after checkinstall to uninstall properly!

# Do not try with Python 3.5, it causes errors
# Do NOT install Anaconda before, it causes compilation issues that are barely solvable
# Do NOT install anything else before compiling Caffe, it causes errors randomly
# ALWAYS use a fresh machine
# It is not super optimized for maximum speed (e.g OpenCV pre-compiled for OpenCL<2, etc.)
# Change all "laurae-linux" to $HOME or to your user username in Linux
# Something not working? Reboot and retry, it takes only 20 seconds. Still not working? Check missing dependencies with the error messages.
# Want to apply .bashrc immediately without rebooting/relaunching a terminal? Use the following: source ~/.bashrc
# Got a permission error? Prepend the command with the following: sudo
# Wanna use R for xgboost? You are out of luck, I never managed to compile it correctly:
# error: unable to load shared object '/usr/local/lib/R/site-library/xgboost/libs/xgboost.so':
#   /usr/local/lib/R/site-library/xgboost/libs/xgboost.so: undefined symbol: _ZN7xgboost4data10SparsePage6Writer5AllocEPSt10unique_ptrIS1_St14default_deleteIS1_EE
# Not happy without the bleeding edge xgboost R? Use Windows because it works perfectly there...
# If you really need xgboost in Linux+R, use the typical online R package on CRAN
# DO NOT CLEAN UP ALL THE FOLDERS AFTER, OR YOU WILL KILL REQUIRED DEPENDENCIES. ADJUST THE SCRIPT IF YOU WANT TO PUT THE FILES ELSEWHERE.
# REMEMBER TO SWITCH YOUR GPU TO AMD (if you use hybrid graphics) IF YOU INTEND TO RUN Caffe ON GPU: YOU WILL RUN ON CPU OTHERWISE!!!

# There are manual steps!!! Check out all the comments every time
# Run this at the beginning to make sure you are at a stable LTS version:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
